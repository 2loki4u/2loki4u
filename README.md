- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris aka '@2loki4u' and I'm principally a Cellular Hardware Applications Engineering and Technical Support Director for a relatively large Antenna, Filter, LTE/5g Base Station and complementary systems, manufacturer. I've been working in the Commercial Cellular World in the US for 26yrs and in the US Army Signal Corp in a similar capacity prior to that. The smorgasbord of products my teams and I support range extensively across the industry, leading us frequently into new disciplines, including supporting software for these products. This has often led me to Github for research on numerous solutions, including Evolved Packet Core solutions, Docker solutions for testing programs, Networking solutions, and a number of other projects in which my colleagues and I have been involved in or depend on for various matters.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in META's MAGMA, EPC solution, Docker Solutions, Linux in general as well as Networking Gear, plus various side projects others have worked on which I encounter in everyday life.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various aspects of META's MAGMA solution, among other things.
